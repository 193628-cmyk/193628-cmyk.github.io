 <h3>Assignment two(Lego SPIKE)</h3> 
<p>For this dancing robot we first coded its arms and legs to move at a specific speed for one rotation and then stop for a second before rotating again. Then we made it so that it moves to the beat of the song playing in the background.</p>

<p>These images include four spinning gear designs, three spinning disk designs, an inage of my first hopper degsign and an image of my second hopper design.<br>For my second hopper design I wanted to use gears to add an extra pair of legs, but it was too heavy to move.</p>
